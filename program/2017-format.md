# 2017 PACE NSC Tournament Format

At the 2017 PACE NSC, there are four stages of play: (1) **Preliminaries**; (2) **Playoffs**; (3) **Super-playoffs** /**Consolations**; (4) **Finals**.

### Stage One: Preliminaries (Saturday before lunch)
The 96 teams have been drawn into 12 groups of 8 before the tournament, accounting for team strength and geographic diversity. Each team will play the other 7 teams in their group on Saturday morning. **At the end of Round 7**, one representative from each team should report to their pool captain to learn whether any tiebreakers are necessary. (see “Tiebreaker Guidelines”). 
 
After the seven preliminary rounds, the The top two teams from each prelim group will advance to Tier I; the next two to Tier II; the next two to Tier III; the last two to Tier IV. In the event that one or more groups is short a team because the field is not a full 96 teams, those groups will send only one team to Tier IV. **something about ties for 1-2 done by ppg; 2-3 done with a half game**


### Stage Two: Playoffs (Saturday after lunch)
The 24 teams in each tier will be placed in 4 groups of 6. The teams will be seeded 1-24 by rank in preliminary group and then points per bonus (PPB), and then the teams will be seeded in groups of equal strength, such that no two teams from the same preliminary group will be placed in the same playoff group. Playoff assignments will be posted by 2:30pm at various points around the second floor of the hotel.

Each team will play the other five teams in their playoff group on Saturday afternoon. At the end of Round 12, teams in Tiers I and II should send one representative to their pool captain to learn whether any tiebreakers are necessary. (see “Tiebreaker Guidelines”).  The top two teams from each Tier I group will advance to the Championship Super-playoffs, and the next two to 9th-16th place Super-playoffs. The last two teams in each Tier I group and the first team in each Tier II group will go to the 17th-28th place Super-playoffs.

In Tiers III and IV, teams are dismissed after Round 12. Any ties will be broken by PPG (see reverse) to place teams in placement groups.

### Stage Three: Super-playoffs and Placements (Sunday before lunch)
Team assignments will be posted online within three hours of the end of Saturday play, and will be posted in the hotel early Sunday morning. Teams should be in their Round 13 room, ready to begin play at 8:15am on Sunday morning.

**In the Championship and 9th-16th place Super-playoffs**, each team will carry over one result from Saturday (against the other team from their playoff group that has advanced to the same Super-playoff group) and will play the other six teams.

**In the 17th-28th place Super-playoffs**, the teams will be split into two pools of six teams each. One pool will have the 1st and 4th best 5th place Tier I teams based on PPB, the 6th place Tier I teams that were in different Playoff pools than those teams, and the 2nd and 3rd best 1st place Tier II teams based on PPB. The other pool will have the other teams in the same places in the pool. The teams will each play a five game round robin within their pools. Teams will be ranked based on record, then PPG, and each team will play the team in the parallel pool that finished in the same spot.

**The teams that finish 6th in Tier II pools will be matched up with teams that finish 1st in Tier III pools**, with the 1st and 4th seeded Tier II 6th place teams being paired with the 2nd and 3rd seeded Tier III 1st place teams, and vice versa. Teams will be ranked based on record, then PPG, and each team will play the team in the parallel pool that finished in the same spot. The same thing will happen for teams that finish 6th in Tier III with teams that finish 1st in Tier IV.
All other teams will play the other three teams with the same rank in a playoff group on their tier to determine their final ranking.

### Stage Four: Finals (Sunday after lunch)
The 2017 PACE NSC champion will be crowned out of the top Super-playoff group as follows:

1. If the top team has a lead of 2 or more games over the next team, they win outright without a final.
2. If the top team has a lead of exactly 1 game, they will play an advantage (two-game) final. The leading team has two chances to win the tournament; the trailing team must win twice to win the tournament.
3. If the top two teams are tied, they will play a one-game, winner-take-all final.

All teams in Tier I not competing for the championship who are tied after Super-playoffs will play tiebreaker games to determine their final rank (see “Tiebreaker Guidelines”). Within a tie, any team that declines or fails to play a tiebreaker will be ranked below teams that do play them. Separately, tiebreakers and finals for the top three JV teams and for the Small School champion will be played. If possible and necessary, these may be played Sunday morning, after the placement games end.

### Tiebreaker Guidelines

If multiple teams in a group are tied in the standings at the end of a stage of play, their ranking will be determined by one of two procedures: Minimatches or Points per Game (PPG).

**After the Stage 1 (preliminary) rounds**, if there is a two-way tie that does not affect which tier the teams will advance to, then the tie will be broken on PPG. For instance, if two teams are tied for 3rd place, that tie will be broken on PPG and both teams will progress to Tier II. In all other circumstances, teams will play Minimatches to break the tie.

**After the Stage 2 (playoff) rounds in Tier I only**, if there is a two-way tie that does not affect which Stage 3 (super-playoff) group the teams will advance to (e.g. two-way tie for 3rd, both teams will advance to the 9th-16th place group), the tie will be broken on PPG.  In all other circumstances, teams will play Minimatches to break the tie.

**After the Stage 3 (super-playoff) rounds for the top 16 teams only**, any teams that are tied in a group will play Minimatches to determine their final rank. This does not necessarily apply to teams that may compete in overall finals.

**After the Stage 2 (playoff) rounds in Tiers II, III, and IV**, if multiple teams are tied for a single spot, they will be ranked by PPG to determine which placement group they will compete in. *The exception is ties for 1st place in Tier II*, which will be played off with Minimatches.
After the placement games in Tiers II, III, or IV, if teams are tied, they will be considered to have equal standing in the final rankings.

PPG – When minimatches will not be played, teams will be ranked by Points per Game for all games in the relevant stage of the tournament. If minimatches are required, seeding will be done by the same criteria. To ensure fairness, points scored in overtime of any game will not be considered in calculating PPG. For super-playoff teams, “the relevant stage” includes the one game from Saturday afternoon that has carried over.

Minimatch Scheduling – When minimatches are required, teams involved in the tie will be seeded A, B, C… on PPG (see above). The procedure will be dependent on how many teams are tied and how many can advance to the higher group in the next stage:
2 teams, 1 spot: The teams play each other. If this is for final ranking, we may use a full game rather than a minimatch.
3 teams, 2 spots: A plays B (Game 1). Loser of 1 plays C (Game 2). Winners of Games 1 and 2 make the top group.
3 teams, 1 spot (or final rank): B plays C (Game 1). Winner of 1 plays A (Game 2). Winner of Game 2 makes top group.
4 teams, breaking 2-2: A plays D (Game 1), B plays C (Game 2). Then winners play (Game 3) and losers play (Game 4). Then loser of Game 3 plays winner of Game 4 (Game 5). Winners of Games 3 and 5 make top group.
4 teams, breaking 1-2-1 (or final rank): A plays D (Game 1), B plays C (Game 2). Then winners play (Game 3) and losers play (Game 4). Winner of Game 3 makes top group, loser of Game 4 makes bottom group; other two make middle group.
For ties of 5 or more teams, similar principles will be followed.
 
Minimatch Game Format – All minimatches will follow standard PACE format (tossup/bonus with powers and bouncebacks) with the following two changes: (1) The standard length is 10, rather than 20, tossup-bonus cycles; (2) There is no halftime substitution opportunity; the only substitution opportunity is between cycle 10 and sudden-death if necessary.

Finals – See the “Tournament Format” for the finals procedure. If exactly two teams are tied for entry into the championship; otherwise minimatches will be played as above. Likewise, a tie for a berth in the JV final, or for 2nd or 3rd place in the JV classification, will be broken with a full game.
